In addition to implementing the device code, answer the following questions:

1) The current value for BINS in config.h is 8, and thus TOTALBINS is 8 * 8 * 8 = 512.  
If you increase the value for BINS to 16 (TOTALBINS = 4096), how is this going to impact
the speedups?  Why?  (See directions in assignment if you want to try this out.)

2) If more models are added to the program, how is this going to impact 
the speedups?  Why?

3) In regards to the classification, what is the advantage of having fewer
bins then the image pixel space (256 * 256 * 256)?

4) What can go wrong if there are too few bins?
